This is a bridge to run windows VST plugins on Linux VST hosts.

= Architecture =

vst-bridge.so.tpl has room for the windows plugin path.

vst-bridge-maker creates a dedicate vst-plugin.so by setting the path to the
windows vst in vst-bridge.so.tpl.

vst-bridge-host.exe hosts a windows vst and receives RPC.

vst-bridge-<plugin>.so starts a new wine process vst-bridge-host.exe and
passes the path to the <plugin>.
